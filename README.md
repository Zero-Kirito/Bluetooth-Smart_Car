# Bluetooth-Smart_Car
This is a bluetooth smart car which can detect and avoid obstacles and steer clear off its path using four IR sensors and one Ultrasonic sensor on top of a micro servo.
It is controlled by HC-05 Bluetooth Module and uses L298N Motor Driver Circuit along with an arduino UNO R3.
It's a simple project made by me on my free time.
Please try it and tell me where the code needs to be changed.
PS: the back IR module code seems to be not working well enough, also DON'T PLUG IN Bluetooth while uploading code or problems WILL arise.
